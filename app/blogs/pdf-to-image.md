If you're running a website, blog, or e-commerce store, **image size matters**. Larger images can significantly slow down page load times, affecting user experience and SEO performance. That’s where our **Image Compressor** comes in.

### Why Image Compression Matters

Every extra kilobyte counts when serving content to your users. High-resolution images may look great, but they often come at the cost of performance. Our Image Compressor solves this by:

- Reducing image file sizes by up to 80%
- Retaining visual quality using smart compression algorithms
- Supporting JPG, PNG, and WEBP formats

No installation, no sign-up—just drag, drop, and compress.

### Features You'll Love

- **Bulk Compression**: Upload multiple images at once
- **Lossless & Lossy Options**: You choose the quality level
- **Fast & Secure**: All processing is done in-browser or on secure servers

This tool is ideal for:

- Bloggers optimizing thumbnails
